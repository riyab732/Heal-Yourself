      <h1>Mental Health Upcoming Events<h1>
    <p> Mental health is a serious concern in academia, across the world and at all levels of professionals. 
    There is an increasing global push to acknowledge and bring discussions on mental health to the forefront(â€˜out of the closetâ€™),
     and seek and share individual and collective solutions to support and promote the mental well-being of academic 
     professionals. Taking the initiative to create awareness and de-stigmatize mental health will be vital to making 
     science in India a more inclusive and supportive place.</p>
